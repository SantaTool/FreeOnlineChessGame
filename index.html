          <strong>History of Chess:</strong><br>
          - Chess originated in northern India in the 6th century as "chaturanga".<br>
          - It spread to Persia, where it became known as "shatranj".<br>
          - After the Islamic conquest of Persia, chess spread throughout the Muslim world and into Southern Europe.<br>
          - By the 15th century, chess had evolved in Europe into its modern form, with new rules for the queen and bishop.<br>
          - The first official chess tournament was held in London in 1851.<br>
          - The World Chess Federation (FIDE) was founded in 1924 to govern international competition.<br>
          - Chess computers began to emerge in the 20th century, with IBM's Deep Blue famously defeating world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.<br>
          - Online chess and streaming have made the game more popular than ever in the 21st century.<br>
          - Chess is now a global game with millions of players, international tournaments, and a rich cultural legacy.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Did you know?</strong><br>
          - The word "checkmate" comes from the Persian phrase "ShƒÅh MƒÅt" (ÿ¥ÿßŸá ŸÖÿßÿ™), meaning "the king is helpless" or "the king is defeated."<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Famous Checkmate Types & Patterns:</strong><br>
          - Back-rank mate ‚Äì exploiting a king trapped behind its own pawns.<br>
          - Smothered mate ‚Äì a knight checkmates a king surrounded by its own pieces.<br>
          - Scholar‚Äôs Mate ‚Äì a quick mate exploiting weak f2/f7 squares.<br>
          - Fool‚Äôs Mate ‚Äì fastest possible checkmate (2 moves).<br>
          - Arabian Mate ‚Äì knight and rook combo mate from ancient Shatranj patterns.<br>

          <strong>How to Play:</strong><br>

          <br>
          <strong>General Chess Rules:</strong><br>
          - Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.<br>
          - White moves first, then players alternate turns.<br>
          - The goal is to checkmate the opponent's king (put it under threat of capture with no escape).<br>
          - Pawns move forward but capture diagonally; they can promote to another piece upon reaching the far side.<br>
          - Knights move in an L-shape; bishops move diagonally; rooks move in straight lines; queens move any direction; kings move one square in any direction.<br>
          - Castling allows the king and a rook to move simultaneously under certain conditions.<br>
          - En passant and pawn promotion are special pawn moves.<br>
          - Stalemate, draw by repetition, and the fifty-move rule can end the game without a winner.<br>
          <strong>Additional Rules & Tips:</strong><br>
          - You cannot move a piece if it would leave your king in check.<br>
          - If a pawn reaches the last rank, you must promote it to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.<br>
          - Castling is not allowed if the king or the chosen rook has already moved, or if the king passes through or ends up in check.<br>
          - If the same position occurs three times, either player can claim a draw (threefold repetition).<br>
          - If no pawn has moved and no capture has been made in the last fifty moves, either player can claim a draw.<br>
          - Touch-move rule: In official play, if you touch a piece, you must move it if it is a legal move.<br>
          - You cannot castle out of, through, or into check.<br>
          - The king is never captured; the game ends immediately when checkmate is delivered.<br>
